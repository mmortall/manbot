# AI Agent Platform Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of the local multi-agent AI runtime platform.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Reflection Strategy**: Support both `NORMAL` (1-pass) and `DEEP` (iterative) modes. The Critic agent returns a `PASS`/`REVISE` decision.
- **Task Isolation**: Every task has its own lifecycle and state stored in SQLite, allowing for replays and resumptions.
- **Model Routing**: The Planner will categorize tasks by complexity (`small`, `medium`, `large`), and the Model Router will select the appropriate Ollama model.
- **Parallel Execution**: The Executor Agent will support concurrent execution of independent DAG nodes to optimize performance.

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **[NEW] Project Initialization**: Set up Node.js, TypeScript, and basic workspace structure.
- **[NEW] Message Protocol & Shared Types**: Define the standard envelope and message types used for IPC.
- **[NEW] Logger Service**: Implement a structured logging service that listens for events from other processes.
- **[NEW] Task Memory Service**: Implement SQLite-based storage for task state, intermediate results, and reflections.

---

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
- **[NEW] Ollama Adapter**: Create a bridge to local Ollama instance with streaming and token usage tracking.
- **[NEW] Model Router**: Implement logic to route requests to appropriate models (small, medium, large).
- **[NEW] Planner Agent**: Implement the agent responsible for intent analysis and generating execution DAGs.

---

### Phase 3: Runtime & Execution
- **[NEW] Executor Agent**: Build the engine that traverses the capability graph and executes nodes.
- **[NEW] Critic Agent**: Implement self-reflection and validation logic to check for hallucinations and logic errors.
- **[NEW] Core Orchestrator**: Develop the main process that supervises other agents, manages task lifecycles, and coordinates flows.

---

### Phase 4: Interface & Extensions
- **[NEW] Telegram Adapter**: Connect the orchestrator to a Telegram Bot interface.
- **[NEW] RAG Service**: Implement FAISS-based vector search for long-term semantic memory.
- **[NEW] Tool Host**: Build a sandbox for executing external tools (File, HTTP, etc.).
- **[NEW] Cron Manager**: Add support for scheduled background jobs.

---

### Phase 5: DevOps & CI
- **[NEW] GitHub Actions Workflow**: Set up basic CI pipeline to automate build and testing.
- **[NEW] CI Build & Test Job**: Configure jobs to run `tsc` and `npm test` on every push to `main`.


---

### Phase 6: Conversation Management
- **[UPDATE] RAG Service Persistence**: Update `RAGService` to persist semantic memory to an SQLite-based store instead of in-memory only.
- **[UPDATE] Task Memory Schema**: Add `conversation_id` to `tasks` table in `TaskMemory` to group tasks into chat sessions.
- **[UPDATE] Telegram Adapter Commands**: Implement `/new` command to trigger conversation archiving and session reset.
- **[UPDATE] Orchestrator Archiving Flow**: Implement logic to handle `chat.new` events:
    - Get history of the current conversation.
    - specialized "Memory Agent" node to summarize and extract key info.
    - Store the extracted info in `RAGService`.
    - Reset the `conversation_id` in `Telegram Adapter` state.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Integration test for `RAGService` persistence (verify data survives restart).
- Unit test for `/new` command parsing in `Telegram Adapter`.
- Integration test for Orchestrator's archiving flow (mock LLM response for summary).

### Manual Verification
- Send messages to Telegram bot, then send `/new`.
- Verify bot responds that previous conversation is archived.
- Send a follow-up question that might benefit from memory (if context injection is implemented) or check the RAG database manually.
