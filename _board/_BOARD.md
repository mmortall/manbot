## To Do

### P1-04 Implement Logger Service

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false

    ```

### P2-01 Implement Ollama Adapter

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false

    ```

### P2-03 Create System Prompts for Planner

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Craft the foundational system prompts that guide the Planner Agent in converting a user message into a structured capability graph (DAG).

    ```

### P2-04 Implement Planner Agent

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Develop the Planner Agent process which takes user intent and produces a structured execution DAG using the Ollama Adapter.

    ```

### P2-05 Validate DAG logic

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Implement algorithmic checks to ensure that the plan produced by the Planner Agent is a valid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) before it reaches the Executor.

    Source: P2-05_VALIDATE_DAG.md
    ```

### P3-01 Implement Executor Agent core loop

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Build the core engine that traverses the capability graph (DAG) and orchestrates the execution of individual nodes in the correct order based on their dependencies.

    Source: P3-01_EXECUTOR_CORE_LOOP.md
    ```

### P3-02 Parallel node execution

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Optimize the Executor Agent to execute independent nodes in parallel, maximizing the utilization of available services and reducing overall task latency.

    Source: P3-02_PARALLEL_EXECUTION.md
    ```

### P3-03 Create System Prompts for Critic

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Develop the system prompts for the Critic Agent, focusing on its role as a quality control layer that evaluates the Executor's draft results for accuracy, logic, and safety.

    Source: P3-03_CRITIC_PROMPTS.md
    ```

### P3-04 Implement Critic Agent process

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Implement the Critic Agent as a standalone process that receives execution results and provides feedback on whether the task is complete and satisfactory.

    Source: P3-04_CRITIC_AGENT.md
    ```

### P3-05 Dynamic Revision Nodes

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Extend the Executor Agent to handle "REVISE" decisions from the Critic by dynamically injecting revision nodes into the execution flow to improve the final result.

    Source: P3-05_REVISION_LOGIC.md
    ```

### P3-06 Build Core Orchestrator

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Develop the central supervisor process that manages the lifecycle of all agents and services, mediates communication, and handles system-wide errors.

    Source: P3-06_CORE_ORCHESTRATOR.md
    ```

### P4-01 Telegram Adapter

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Develop a standalone service to interface the AI Agent platform with Telegram, allowing users to interact with the system via a bot.

    Source: P4-01_TELEGRAM_ADAPTER.md
    ```

### P4-02 Connect Telegram to Orchestrator

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Integrate the Telegram Adapter with the Core Orchestrator to enable the standard task creation and execution flow triggered by Telegram messages.

    Source: P4-02_TELEGRAM_INTEGRATION.md
    ```

### P4-03 Implement RAG Service

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) service using the FAISS vector database to provide the system with long-term semantic memory and document access.

    Source: P4-03_RAG_SERVICE.md
    ```

### P4-04 Semantic Search Node

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Create a new node type in the capability graph that allows the Executor to invoke the RAG service for retrieving context.

    Source: P4-04_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_NODE.md
    ```

### P4-05 Build Tool Host

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Implement a secure and isolated tool execution host that allows the platform to perform actions in the physical world (filesystem, network, etc.).

    Source: P4-05_TOOL_HOST.md
    ```

### P4-06 Cron Manager

  - tags: [pending]
  - defaultExpanded: false
    ```md
    Add a service for managing scheduled background tasks, such as periodic maintenance, database optimization, or recurring AI actions.

    Source: P4-06_CRON_MANAGER.md
    ```
